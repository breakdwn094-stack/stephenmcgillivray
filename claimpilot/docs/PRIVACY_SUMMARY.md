## What We Collect

ClaimPilot collects only the information you voluntarily enter into the application:

- **Case intake data:** Names, addresses, contact information, claim details
- **Evidence metadata:** File names, types, and sizes (not file contents after session ends)
- **Generated documents:** Temporarily cached in your browser session

## Where Your Data Lives

- All data is stored **locally in your browser session**.
- Data is **not transmitted to third-party servers** unless you explicitly export or share it.
- No server-side persistence of user data occurs in the current version.

## How We Use Your Data

Your data is used **solely** to generate the documents and guidance you request.
We do not sell, share, or monetize your data in any way.

## Data Deletion

You may delete all your data at any time using the **"Delete My Data"** tab.
This clears:
- All intake form fields
