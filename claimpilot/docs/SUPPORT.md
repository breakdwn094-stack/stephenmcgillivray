## Common Questions

### What is ClaimPilot?
ClaimPilot is an informational tool that guides you through the small claims court process. It helps you prepare documents, organize evidence, and understand your state's requirements.

### Is ClaimPilot a law firm?
No. ClaimPilot is not a law firm and does not provide legal advice. No attorney-client relationship is formed through use of this application. We strongly recommend consulting a licensed attorney for advice specific to your situation.

### What does "Tier 1" vs "Tier 2" mean?
- **Tier 1 (Supported):** ClaimPilot has verified state-specific form mappings for your state. Generated documents use these verified templates.
- **Tier 2 (Guidance-only):** ClaimPilot provides general templates. You must verify that generated documents meet your local court's specific requirements before filing.
